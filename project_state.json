  "summary": "Project involves a TAYARI-branded app with an intro page featuring a teal/green gradient background. Work is ongoing to make the TAYARI logo PNG transparent (removing white/checkered background) and make the signature (जनक प्रसाद पाण्डे) smaller with no black background, so both blend with the intro page color.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Intro page uses a teal/green gradient background; logo and signature images must have transparent backgrounds to blend correctly.",
    "Use CSS mix-blend-mode: multiply and background: transparent to remove white/black boxes around PNG images."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "TAYARI logo PNG has a visible white/checkered background that does not match the intro page teal gradient.",
    "Signature (जनक प्रसाद पाण्डे) has a black background box and needs to be made smaller."
