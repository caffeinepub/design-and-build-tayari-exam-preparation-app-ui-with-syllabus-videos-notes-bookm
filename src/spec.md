# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make Add buttons visible and consistently styled across all management sections in the admin panel.

**Planned changes:**
- Add prominent Add buttons with shadow and mix colors to SyllabusManagementForm, StandaloneVideoManagementForm, and StandaloneNoteManagementForm
- Ensure all Add buttons use consistent shadow styling and mix colors matching the existing implementation in ExamManagementForm, GKManagementForm, IQManagementForm, OldQuestionsManagementForm, SecondPaperManagementForm, and ThirdPaperManagementForm
- Verify button visibility across all management sections including GK topics, IQ categories, Second Paper topics, Third Paper topics, Syllabus, Old Questions, Exam, and Notes

**User-visible outcome:** All Add buttons across management sections are prominently visible with consistent shadow and color styling, making it easier for admins to add new content in any section.
