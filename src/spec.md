# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the splash screen branding, simplify the dashboard header, and reduce the dashboard course card height.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the splash screen logo with a new static PNG showing a person preparing for PSC with many books, and set the splash tagline text to exactly "सफलता को साथी".
- Remove the small AppLogo (earth/globe-with-book) from the main Dashboard header row while keeping the header layout aligned.
- Reduce the vertical height of the "खरिदार तयारी कोर्स" course card on the Dashboard by tightening bottom spacing while keeping left/right/top edges consistent and ensuring content remains readable.

**User-visible outcome:** The splash screen shows the new PSC-preparation logo with the tagline "सफलता को साथी", the dashboard header no longer shows the small globe logo, and the खरिदार course card appears shorter without clipping content.
