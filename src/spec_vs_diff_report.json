The admin panel is accessible via routing with authentication/authorization guards, forms are created for all content sections (Syllabus, GK, IQ, Second Paper, Third Paper, Exams, standalone Videos and Notes), and backend storage with CRUD operations is implemented. All forms include required fields (title, description, URLs) with Nepali language support. The implementation uses React Query for immediate UI updates without requiring app rebuild.",
