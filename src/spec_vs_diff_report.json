REQ-40 (shorter course card height) is claimed in the summary but cannot be verified from the truncated Dashboard.tsx diff snippet provided.",

      "requirement": "Make the \"खरिदार तयारी कोर्स\" course card/box on the Dashboard smaller in vertical size by reducing its effective height (primarily by bringing the bottom edge/spacing upward) while keeping the left, right, and top visual edges consistent with the current design.",
      "reason": "The Dashboard.tsx diff is truncated before the Courses section/card styling; the provided snippet does not show any concrete change to the course card height/padding, so implementation cannot be confirmed from available diff evidence.",
