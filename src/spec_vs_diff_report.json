  "summary": "REQ-33 is partially addressed by pointing the AppLogo component to a new PNG path, but the actual PNG asset was not added in the diff and extra fallback behavior was introduced. REQ-34 does not show a clear, targeted resize of the specified container div; instead, the diff shows styling on a YouTube player wrapper, which may not correspond to the requested XPath-scoped container resize.",

      "id": "REQ-33",
      "requirement": "Add a new PNG logo asset (3D education globe with graduation cap, transparent background) to frontend static assets and ensure it is rendered for the selected logo <img> element without broken-image errors.",
      "reason": "The code references `/assets/generated/app-logo.dim_512x512.png`, but the diff shows no added files; therefore the required PNG asset itself is not evidenced as added, and the app may still render a broken image if the file doesn’t exist.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\"",
        "frontend/src/components/AppLogo.tsx (references `/assets/generated/app-logo.dim_512x512.png`)"

      "id": "REQ-34",
      "requirement": "Adjust styling of the selected container element at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/section[1]/div[1] so it is slightly larger than the embedded YouTube player while keeping layout stable and without horizontal scrolling.",
      "reason": "The diff shows styling applied to a wrapper around `YouTubePlayer` (`div` with `mb-6 p-4 ... rounded-xl`), but does not clearly show resizing/retuning of the specific container div described by the XPath (main/section/div[1]).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/SubjectContent.tsx (shows `YouTubePlayer` wrapped in `div className=\"mb-6 p-4 bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-xl\"` but does not explicitly show changes to the XPath-referenced container div)"

      "description": "Added fallback logo-switching logic with React state and an `onError` handler to swap to `/assets/generated/thah-study-logo.dim_512x512.png` if the primary logo fails.",
      "reason": "REQ-33 only asked to replace the displayed logo with the new PNG and ensure it renders; it did not request adding a fallback mechanism or a secondary logo behavior.",
