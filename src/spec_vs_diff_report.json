  "summary": "Most requested frontend updates appear implemented: custom logo with fallback (AppLogo) used on SplashScreen and Dashboard, cohesive warm gradient backgrounds via app-page-bg across key pages, video search on SubjectContent and VideoBookmarks, Nepali translations in several navigation/page areas, Dashboard course thumbnails, and an exam set configuration that includes a First Paper marked comingSoon. However, there are signs that the Exam UI may not yet enforce the “Coming soon” behavior (prevent starting timer/opening content), and some English UI may remain (e.g., AppErrorBoundary per repo summary).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "First Paper option must show a clear “Coming soon” state and prevent starting the timer / opening content when First Paper URLs are not configured.",
      "reason": "examSets marks first-paper as comingSoon with empty urls, but Exam.tsx’s selectedExam type and handleStartExam signature do not include/consider a comingSoon flag; the current logic starts the timer for any selected exam, and there is no shown conditional that blocks starting for comingSoon items.",

      "requirement": "Replace remaining English UI text across the app with Nepali text (or bilingual where necessary), including common actions and empty-state messages.",
      "reason": "Repository summary indicates AppErrorBoundary still displays an English fallback screen with a reload button; this suggests not all user-visible UI strings are translated.",
